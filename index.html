                <h3>The Korean Language</h3>
                <p> The official language of Korea is Korean (Wikipedia contributors, 2020a). 
                    Korean just like many other languages, has many dialects unique to a region of South Korea; 
                    this might make it hard for visitors who don’t have a strong grasp of the Korean language (Wikipedia contributors, 2020a). 
                    Another thing that is unique about Korean is that it has honorifics, when talking to someone with higher status, 
                    the speaker with lower status must speak using special nouns or verb endings to highlight the difference in 
                    status (Wikipedia contributors, 2020a). Honorifics in the past used to very hierarchical but nowadays is mostly 
                    used to show respect typically to individuals older than the speaker, employer, teacher, customers, and other similar 
                    individuals (Wikipedia contributors, 2020a). The written system in Korean is called Hangul and was created by 
                    King Sejong to help promote literacy among the common people as back then Chinese characters were used (Wikipedia contributors, 2020a). Hangul was actually denounced by the Yangban, 
                    Korean high class, due to it being easy to learn but nonetheless became widespread (Wikipedia contributors, 2020a).</p>

                <h3>South Korean History</h3>
                <p> The history of Korea is long and would require extensive explanation, hence only the colonial 
                    period of South Korean history will be explained here. In 1910, the empire of Japan annexed Korea 
                    through the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty (Wikipedia contributors, 2020b). During this annexation, 
                    many traditional Korean customs and the Korean language were suppressed, and economic policies were 
                    implemented primarily for Japanese benefits (Wikipedia contributors, 2020b). The annexation ended 
                    after World War 2 after Japan surrounded to the Allied Forces; however this led to the split of the 
                    Korean peninsula with the Soviet Union taking over the north of the 38th parallel and the United States 
                    taking over the south of the 38th parallel (Wikipedia contributors, 2020b). On 1950, the Korean War 
                    broke out which devastated both the North and the South; with led to an armistice which still exists 
                    to this day (Wikipedia contributors, 2020b). This devastated the South Korean economy but since the 
                    1950s and then on South Korean economy gained incredible growth now known as the Miracle of the 
                    Han River (Wikipedia contributors, 2020b). Nowadays, South Korea is well known for its pop culture 
                    which is booming abroad, this phenomenon often referred to as the Korean Wave (Wikipedia contributors, 2020b).</p>
