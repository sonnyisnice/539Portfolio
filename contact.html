                <h3>About the Creator and Website</h3>
                <p>The creator for this project's name is Sonny Kim, a current master's student at the University of Michigan
                    School of Information. While born in South Korea, Sonny attended high school in America and is a proud
                    American Citizen. He decided to make this project for the one of his courses at the University of Michigan.
                    He hopes that this website will be a first step for users to briefly explore and get users curious to learn
                    more about other cultures, which in this is South Korea. The website aims to address accessibility through
                    by reducing motion when necessary and keyboard accessible by allowing users to skip to the main content. It
                    tries to be inclusive by utilizing Korean and English text when appropriate.

                <h3>Potential FAQs</h3>
                <br><p>Which city is the author from: The author is from Suwon, but has visited all the cities mentioned except for Ulsan</p>
                <br><p>Where can I learn more about the places to visit: The best way is to probably look at travel reviews of these locations, there are a variety of travel sites and blogs to choose from</p>
                <br><p>Where can I learn more about the dishes: The problem with Korean dishes is that often there is a lot of variations of the same dish; I am not an expert on Korean cuisine but there are plenty of recipes to try if one wishes to recreate some of these dishes</p>
                <br><p>How come the romantization isn't the same: Romantization of Korean to english is difficult due to language differences, when appropriate I translated accordingly but sometimes a transaltion is not possible so the best romantization was done</p>
                <br><p>What about activities, what activites can I do in South Korea: This varies among individuals, but it is very likely you will be able to find an activity to do in Korea you would enjoy</p>
